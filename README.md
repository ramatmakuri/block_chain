# Block Chain Application
In this assignment, a block chain application will be created with the following features: 

1. Accepts user input and then stores that input in a data class


2. Use the hashlib library to hash any input


3. Create a Block chain with previous hash, and nonce


4. Validate the entire blockchain


5. Build a streamlit application that can a.generate new blocks b. add them to python blockchain c. display the blockchain, and d. display the results of validation 



Results in the streamlit application are provided below:



Data source: Input in Streamlit application

Packages Used This project leverages python 3.7

Installation Guide: The application requires the below programs to be installed
